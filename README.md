Tennis Match Prediction
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for processing historical ATP and WTA tennis data to predict match win probabilities.

The model for ATP Tennis is currently a combination of ridge regressions and LightGBM stacked models to predict match point differentials and win probabilities. The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available ATP and WTA match results provided by Jeff Sackmann. See: https://github.com/JeffSackmann
